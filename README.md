# Middle Tree Welcome Website
This is a website made for the non-profit organization [Middle Tree](https://www.middletree.org/). It was built using React and is deployed via github pages.

## How to Edit
I have designed this website so that it's content is as easy to edit as possible. To edit the content of the welcome pages, or add a new one, you need to edit [this](https://github.com/theobayard/middletree-welcome-info/blob/main/src/Content.js) file. If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, editing just the text you can see on the website won't break anything, unless you use a quotation mark. If you really need to use a quotation mark, use \\" instead of ". If you know any JSX you can write JSX code in place of the strings (JSX is very similar to html, if you know html you could probably write JSX). You can create new pages, sections, or list elements by copying and pasting a previous one below the copied one. When you do this, be very careful to copy everything, including the beginning { and ending },. If there is a } immediately before the { you paste, there needs to be a comma between the two. After you edit, all you need to do is save your changes and my github actions will take care of the rest. If the website doesn't change, you probably got the formatting wrong. Go check under the github actions tab above to see what failed.
