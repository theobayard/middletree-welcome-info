# Middle Tree Welcome Website
This is a website made for the non-profit organization [Middle Tree](https://www.middletree.org/). It was built using React and is deployed via github pages.

## How to Edit
I have designed this website so that it's content is as easy to edit as possible. To edit the content of the welcome pages, or add a new one, you need to edit [this](https://github.com/theobayard/middletree-welcome-info/blob/main/src/Content.js) file. If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, editing just the text you can see on the website won't break anything, unless you use a quotation mark. If you really need to use a quotation mark, use \\" instead of ". You can create new pages, sections, or list elements by copying and pasting a previous one below the copied one. When you do this, be very careful to copy everything, including the beginning { and ending },. If there is a } immediately before the { you paste, there needs to be a comma between the two.
