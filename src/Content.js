                <p>Our organization, Middle Tree, offers <b>supplemental </b> 
                    education for students K-12. Our mission is to provide affordable, 
                    effective education that supports your teachers. Unlike other 
                    tutoring or after school programs, we help students with work that is 
                    already assigned. Our mission is your mission. </p>
                <p>We measure student success based on improvement. For example, one of 
                    our students joined the program with a 4% grade and now has reached 
                    40%--great improvement, on the road to success. This is not to say 
                    we only help students in crisis, we are here to serve all students. 
                    Once enrolled, students will receive one-on-one help from our team 
                    of specially trained staff (even over zoom).</p></>,
